    <h3>1. Marcus Aurelius governed Rome together with his brother.</h3>

    <p class="inline-p">Marcus and his brother Lucius shared the throne as co-emperors after Antoninus Pius passed away in 161 AD. 
     Marcus had a remarkable and flawless character. 
     He and his brother combined their influence to further the interests of the empire.
     He was excellent at handling his administrative responsibilities, but not when it came to fighting. 
     Marcus had never been in charge of an army. Despite having no prior combat experience, he was successful in Rome.
     Marcus received a new name once he was crowned emperor. Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus was his new name. 
     Emperors' names and titles were frequently lengthy back then.
     He had more authority even though he and his brother shared the same level of authority.</p>
     

    <h3>2. Marcus Aurelius battled for the most of his time being a emperor.</h3>
    <p>Within the boundaries of the Roman Empire, Marcus Aurelius' reign is seen as a part of the time of comparatively calm.
     This did not imply that there were no armed conflicts taking place along its boundaries.
     The empire's longest war took place between AD 161 and AD 166. Along with the rebellious Kingdom of Armenia, the Roman Empire was engaged in conflict with the Parthian Empire.
      The conflict between his realm and Germany was also ongoing.
     Marcus was unable to overcome his adversaries in the north. He battled these disobedient tribes till his passing in 180 AD.</p>

    <h3>3. His book named: Meditation, is still quite popular today.</h3>
    <p>The Meditations is a book that contains a compilation of his ideas. 
     He wrote the book himself and it is based on his Stoic principles.
     Marcus discussed his deepest ideas and the difficulties he had to face as the Roman emperor. 
     He described his fears and addictions in this book that he authored in Greek.</p>

    <h3>4. His Family had money.</h3>
    <img src="/assets/css/images/marcus-aurelius-horse.jpg" alt="Marcus Aurelius on horse" class="picture-right">
    <p>Marcus came from a well-off, powerful political family. 
      The Caelian Hill, a fashionable neighborhood with lots of aristocratic villas, was where his family lived.
      Marcus's grandfather spent the majority of his childhood in a palace owned by the Lateran. 
      This benefit played a major role in his designation as an heir at the age of 17.
      His family was a member of the dynasty that ruled. The dynasties of Nerva, Trajan 
     and Hadrian produced a number of notable emperors during that time. 
      Marcus' mother came from a well-off family as well. Her father ran a prosperous construction business.</p>

    <h3>5. The authority of Marcus Aurelius was questioned.</h3>
    <p> As emperor, he did not have an easy time. It was once a possibility that he would be removed from office.
     There were rumors that he was seriously ill and was no longer able to rule the Roman Empire.
    Marcus left for the east after learning of this to take back control of his Empire.
      The self-proclaimed emperor was killed by his own soldiers.
     Faustina, his wife, accompanied Marcus on his journey to reclaim his power. 
       Sadly, his wife passed away while he was on this tour.
     Marcus Aurelius is best known for his thoughtfulness and his rational approach to government.</p>
